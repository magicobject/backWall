The BACKWALL algorithm was something I dreamed up in 1997/8

The idea is to generate a sequence of cryptographic keys that should be used one time only.

They are used in a reducing sequence, using them in that sequence makes it extremely difficult to predict earlier key values.

k10, k9, k8, k7 etc.

One master key is used to generate all subsequent keys.

For very large key numbers there is a neat trick to generate them really quickly:

instead of O(Hash(N))  where N is a large positive integer divide N up into 8 byte sections.

Let M0 be the master key, then key N is

M1 = BW(Hash(8B(M0,N)))
M2 = BW(Hash(8B(M1,N)))
M3 = BW(Hash(8B(M2,N)))
etc.


You can use a key sequence as an encryption mechanism. Series of keys can be 
used as a (perhpas one time) pad. This can then be ORed with the text to be 
encrypted. To decrypt just renenerate the pad and OR with the encrypted message.


HISTORY

circa 2010 PHP version
August 2015 - converted to PHP 5.6, PSR-4, modern naming conventions, comments.
August 2015 - Add a hash strategy so any hash algorithm can be used, provided that the hash length is a constant.
