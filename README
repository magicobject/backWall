The BACKWALL algorithm was something I dreamed up in 1997/8

The idea is to generate a sequence of cryptographic keys that should be used one time only.

They are used in a reducing sequence, using them in that sequence makes it extremely difficult to predict earlier key values.

k10, k9, k8, k7 etc.

One master key is used to generate all subsequent keys.

For very large key numbers there is a neat trick to generate them really quickly:

instear on O(MD5(N))  where N is a large positive integer divide N up into 8 byte sections.

Let M0 be the master key, then key N is

M1 = BW(MD5(8B(M0,N)))
M2 = BW(MD5(8B(M1,N)))
M3 = BW(MD5(8B(M2,N)))
etc.
